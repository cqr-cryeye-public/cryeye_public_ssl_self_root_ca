# CryEye Self-signed Root CA

Self-signed Root CA certificate for Cryeye-related services.

- Click **Import**
- Select **Cryeye_Self_Root_CA.crt** from **certs/Cryeye_Self_Root_CA/**

### Add rootCA (for CryEye) certificate to a system:

Make this, if needed to run some scripts and access to services behind certificates signed by this RootCA.

Can be used in docker.

Need to run this script with root privileges, if run in a local system.

In docker run it as root.

```bash
sudo su
```

Then copy and run this script:

```bash
SCRIPT_NAME="deploy_root_ca_system.sh"
PATH_TO_SCRIPT="/tmp/${SCRIPT_NAME}"
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cqr-cryeye-public/cryeye_public_ssl_self_root_ca/main/scripts/deploy_root_ca/${SCRIPT_NAME} \
--output-document ${PATH_TO_SCRIPT}  &&\
chmod +x ${PATH_TO_SCRIPT} &&\
"${PATH_TO_SCRIPT}" &&\
rm ${PATH_TO_SCRIPT}
```

### Add rootCA (for CryEye) certificate to a python environment:

You need to have "certifi" package installed.

Run it from a python environment, where you want to add this certificate. For example, from a virtual environment.

!!!
Warning.
This script "append" certificate to a file.
So, if you run it multiple times, it will add multiple copies
of the same certificate.

```bash
SCRIPT_NAME="deploy_root_ca_python.sh"
PATH_TO_SCRIPT="/tmp/${SCRIPT_NAME}"
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cqr-cryeye-public/cryeye_public_ssl_self_root_ca/main/scripts/deploy_root_ca/${SCRIPT_NAME} \
--output-document ${PATH_TO_SCRIPT}  &&\
chmod +x ${PATH_TO_SCRIPT} &&\
${PATH_TO_SCRIPT} &&\
rm ${PATH_TO_SCRIPT}
```
